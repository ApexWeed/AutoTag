# AutoTag
Tags music files based on filenames.

Hasn't been updated for a long time and only supports title, artist, album, year, and track number. Ignore the rename buttons (as it does precisely nothing) and refer to [Tag Renamer](https://github.com/ApexWeed/TagRenamer) if you need that functionality.

Drag and drop files onto the program, edit the input format (and optionally output format if you want to check tags are being found) and press save tags to save them.
